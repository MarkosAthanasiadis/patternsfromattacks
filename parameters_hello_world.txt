parameters
______________

This is the import file holding the parameters of the analysis. 
Essential information needs to be filled in each time a new dataset is to be used.
  
        
        - nice id       -> the nice value describing the priority of code compilation. Available options are integers
                           between -19 and 19. 
                           if -19  nice  0      is chosen high   priority is requested (quick and urgend jobs)
                           if nice=0 or nice=n  is chosen normal priority is requested 
                           if   0 < nice < 19   is chosen low    priority is requested (long and  non-urgend jobs)
        
        - core id       -> the amount of physical computational cores needed for code compilation. Available options are
                           integers above 0 and below the total amount of physical cores in your machine/cluster.
                           if   core = -1         is chosen all available cores will be used (default option)
        
        - main path     -> the directory holding the dataset
                           e.g. /home/athanasiadis/Documents/
        
        - dataset name  -> the name of the file holding the data
                           e.g. hello_world
        
        - model id      -> the type of ANN required. Available options are linear or non-linear.
                          e.g. linear (default option)
        
        - learning rate -> the learning rate for the ANN.
                          e.g. 0.001 (default option)
        
        - epochs #      -> the amount of training epochs for the ANN.
                          e.g. 1000 (default option)
        
        - subsampling # -> the amount of subsamplings required.
                          e.g. 100 (default option)
                         
                         
        Permutation test parameters
        
        - shuffle id    -> the type of permutation test required. Available options are block or full
                          block is a trial based shuffling of the labels
                          full  is a pattern based shuffling of the labels
        
        - shuffle #     -> the amount of shuffles needed for the permutation test.
                          e.g. 1000 (default option)
        
        
        Adversarial classifier parameters
        
        - ring domain   -> the minimum and maximum radius values of the ring shaped domain including the closest neighboors
                          in terms of percentage relative to the furthest neighboor
                          e.g. [5,35] (default option)  
        
        - clustering id -> the minimum samples and radius of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm used
                          e.g. [3,0.25] (default values)
